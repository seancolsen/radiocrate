# Containerized development & testing

This project ships a Docker setup so you can do development and testing inside a container. The main reason is to run **Claude Code with full permissions** (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) safely.

## How it's wired up

- The project directory is bind-mounted at `/workspace` inside the container, so edits on the host (or by the agent in the container) are immediately visible on both sides.
- Build artifacts are kept in a named volume mounted at `/workspace/target`, so the container's builds **don't clobber your host `./target`** and persist across container runs.
- The cargo registry and git caches are persisted in named volumes, so crates aren't re-downloaded every time.
- The host `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json` are mounted into the container, so the container reuses your existing Claude Code login.

## First-time setup

Build the image (takes a few minutes — it compiles `wasm-pack` tooling and installs Node/Claude Code):

```sh
docker compose build
```

If your host UID/GID aren't 1000:1000, pass them explicitly:

```sh
docker compose build --build-arg USER_UID=$(id -u) --build-arg USER_GID=$(id -g)
```

## Daily use

Open an interactive shell in the container:

```sh
docker compose run --rm dev
```

`--rm` removes the container when you exit; the named volumes (build cache, crate cache) survive, so the next run is fast.

Inside the container you're at `/workspace` with the full toolchain so you can run cargo commands.

### Running Claude Code with full permissions

From inside the container shell:

```sh
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Because the container is isolated and only your project (plus caches) is mounted, you can let the agent run commands without approving each one.

To jump straight into Claude Code without a separate shell step:

```sh
docker compose run --rm dev claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Visual regression tests (frontend UI)

The frontend has snapshot tests (built on [`egui_kittest`](https://crates.io/crates/egui_kittest)) that render individual widgets headlessly to PNGs under `frontend/tests/snapshots/`. Every scene is captured twice through the shared rig in `frontend/src/snapshot_harness.rs` — once per theme — and the two frames are stacked into a single baseline: **light mode on top, dark mode on bottom**, split by a 2-device-px gray (`#808080`) rule. Each stacked image is compared against a committed baseline, so unintended UI changes in either theme show up as a test failure with a `*.diff.png` to inspect. Only the `*.png` baselines are committed; the `*.new.png` / `*.diff.png` / `*.old.png` side files are transient and gitignored.

**Run these in the container only.** They render through the container's software Vulkan driver (lavapipe, installed in the `Dockerfile`). Rendering on a host with a different GPU, driver, or font stack produces slightly different pixels and spurious diffs, so the committed baselines are only valid when generated in the container.

From inside the container:

```sh
# Run the visual regression tests against the committed baselines.
cargo test -p frontend snapshot_tests

# Approve changes: overwrite the baselines with the freshly rendered images.
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test -p frontend snapshot_tests
```

From the host (no shell needed — Docker runs the test, writes baselines to the bind-mounted source):

```sh
# Run the tests.
docker compose run --rm dev cargo test -p frontend snapshot_tests

# Approve / regenerate the baselines.
docker compose run --rm -e UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 dev cargo test -p frontend snapshot_tests
```

### Inspecting & measuring a failure

When a snapshot test fails, egui_kittest writes three sibling artifacts next to
the committed baseline `<name>.png`, in the same `frontend/tests/snapshots/…`
directory. They're all gitignored (throwaway, rewritten every run):

| File               | What it is                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<name>.diff.png`  | A visual diff highlighting the changed pixels.                    |
| `<name>.new.png`   | The freshly rendered image.                                       |
| `<name>.old.png`   | The previous baseline — only after `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS` rewrote it.  |

**`<name>.diff.png` is the fastest way to see _what_ changed** — open it first.
To see all three at once, stitch them into one `old | diff | new` strip:

```sh
scripts/snapshot_composite.sh frontend/tests/snapshots/<group>/<name>.png
# -> writes <name>.composite.png (also gitignored)
```

To **measure** an image to the pixel — e.g. confirm a margin is symmetric rather
than eyeball it — use the measurement helper. It bakes in the rendering
conventions (2× device scale / **PPP = 2**, the **8 logical-px harness margin**
the test crop leaves around the content, and the resting border gray
**`#C8C8C8`**) and classifies pixels as background / border / fill / content.
Its pixel classification assumes the light palette, so aim it at the **top
(light) half** of a stacked baseline; on the dark half, only its raw scan
coordinates are trustworthy:

```sh
# Whole-image summary: size, content bbox, per-side margins, symmetry checks.
scripts/measure_snapshot.py frontend/tests/snapshots/<group>/<name>.new.png

# Horizontal scan at a device-pixel row (default: vertical middle); --col for a
# vertical scan. Coordinates are device px; pass --logical to give them in
# logical px. --json for machine-readable output.
scripts/measure_snapshot.py <png> --row 41
```

It runs on plain `python3` (Pillow + NumPy are baked into the image), so a
`from PIL import Image` script works out of the box if you'd rather poke at
pixels directly.

## Optional: VS Code / Codespaces dev container

If you use VS Code, [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) lets you run your **whole editor** inside this same container instead of opening a shell with `docker compose run`. It's a supplement — it reuses the exact same `docker-compose.yml` (Dockerfile, cache volumes, UID matching, entrypoint), so nothing about the CLI workflow above changes.

With the **Dev Containers** extension installed, open the Command Palette and choose **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container."** VS Code builds/starts the compose service, installs `rust-analyzer` and the Claude Code extension inside it, and reopens the workspace at `/workspace`. Your terminal, language server, and Claude Code now all run in the container — so the agent's command execution is confined there too, which is the same isolation goal as running `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in the shell.

Notes specific to the dev container:

- It sets `overrideCommand: true` so VS Code keeps the container alive with its own keep-alive process; our `entrypoint.sh` still runs first, so the cache-volume ownership fix still applies.
- The shared `~/.claude` credential mount works the same locally. In **cloud Codespaces** there's no host `~/.claude` to mount, so you'd log into Claude Code separately inside the Codespace.
- This file is only meaningful to VS Code / Codespaces / the `devcontainer` CLI. Plain `docker compose` users can ignore it.

## Maintenance

- Rebuild the image after changing the `Dockerfile`:

    `docker compose build`
  
- Wipe the cached build artifacts and crates (forces a clean rebuild):

    `docker compose down -v`

- Bump the Rust version by editing the `FROM rust:1.91-bookworm` line in the `Dockerfile` to match a new host toolchain.
