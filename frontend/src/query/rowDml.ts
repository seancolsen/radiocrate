// A DML request run in the context of one query result row.
//
// Both of the app's writes happen against a row that's on screen: the play log,
// written as a track finishes, and the record editor's save. Neither shows up in
// the grid on its own — the row was decoded from a result set that the write has
// just made out of date, by exactly one row.
//
// Re-running the whole query would be the wrong fix. A query filtered on "fewer
// than ten plays" drops the track the listener has just finished the moment its
// tenth play lands: the row they were looking at vanishes as its reward, and
// anything they wanted to do with it goes with it. Nor can the row be patched
// where it sits — a play count is an aggregate DuckDB computed, and guessing at
// what a write did to a derived value is exactly the arithmetic the frontend
// shouldn't be doing. What the row needs is the *same query, restricted to the
// one record it stands for*:
//
//   • A **sectioned** query — the builder's base/filter/sort/display — is picked
//     apart. The filter section is replaced with conditions matching the record's
//     key, the sort is dropped (one row has no order), and the base and display
//     are left exactly as they were: the same compiler run over the same display
//     produces the same columns, and the single row that comes back is the row,
//     refreshed.
//
//   • A **full**, hand-written query can't be picked apart, so it's re-run whole
//     and the row looked for in the answer, matched on the records it identifies.
//     It may well not be there — the query may have filtered it out, which is the
//     very thing the narrowed path exists to avoid — and then the row is left as
//     it was. That's the trade the whole-query path makes.
//
// The module deals only in *reading the row back*; where those cells then go
// (into the tab's stored result, in place) is the store's business.
