// The playback engine: a pair of long-lived `<audio>` elements plus the play
// context (history / current / queue) they navigate.
//
// Everything that advances playback lives *here*, off the UI: the queue of
// upcoming track ids is snapshotted when playback starts, and the element's
// `ended` handler pulls from it directly. Those handlers fire from the browser's
// media-event dispatch, which keeps running while the PWA is backgrounded and
// the device is locked — so a track ending auto-advances to the next one with no
// help from React, the store, or a repaint. The UI is a *subscriber* to that
// (`EngineEvents`), never the driver.
//
// ## Why two elements
//
// A backgrounded page is only kept alive as a side effect of *actually
// rendering audio*: that is what holds Android's audio focus, keeps the tab out
// of Chrome's freezer, and keeps its network loads unthrottled. The moment a
// track ends, that exemption lapses. A design that then has to open a fresh
// stream — DNS, TLS, a service-worker cold start, the first media bytes — is
// asking the platform for network and CPU in the one window where it is least
// inclined to give them. On stricter Android builds the load simply stalls until
// the app is foregrounded again, which reads to the user as "playback stops
// after one track, and jumps to the next when I open the app".
//
// So the next track is loaded *while the current one is still playing*, into a
// second element held paused and buffered. The `ended` handler then only has to
// swap which element is active and call `play()` on data that is already in
// memory — no network on the critical path, and the gap in rendered audio is one
// JS task rather than a round trip. Every fetch the engine performs happens in
// the safe window: while audio is playing.
