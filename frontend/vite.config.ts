 *
 * The id goes two places: a `__BUILD_ID__` constant compiled into the bundle,
 * and `dist/build-id.txt`, which `rust-embed` bakes into the binary — the
 * release build does the frontend first (`cargo xtask build-release`), so the
 * embedded copy is always the one belonging to the embedded client. The server
 * reports it over `app.version` and the client compares it against its own, so
 * the two differ exactly when the client is stale. No git needed at runtime, and
 * no way for the two to drift.
 *
 * The short commit hash mirrors `radiocrate/build.rs`, which keeps a release
 * built from a clean checkout reproducible. A dirty tree — or no git at all —
 * falls back to a timestamp, which is what makes successive rebuilds
 * distinguishable while iterating.
