//! The shared wire contract between `RadioCrate`'s backend and its generated
//! TypeScript client.
//!
//! Every request/response type that crosses the `POST /api/rpc` boundary is
//! defined here exactly once, so the backend (which `use`s these structs in
//! [`crate`]-consuming code like `backend::rpc`) and the client generator
//! (`cargo xtask gen-api`, which reads [`type_decls`] and [`METHODS`]) can never
//! drift apart.
//!
//! # The two casings
//!
//! The Rust code stays `snake_case` (the server's idiom, and what the DB columns
//! and SQL use); the *wire* is `camelCase`. Each struct carries
//! `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`, so serde renames the fields only at
//! (de)serialization — the transformation lives on the server, at the boundary.
//! `ts-rs` reads that same serde attribute (its default `serde-compat` feature),
//! so the generated `.ts` types match the wire exactly and the client needs no
//! conversion of its own.
//!
//! Because serde's `rename_all` renames only *declared* struct fields, the DML
//! method's free-form maps — keyed by *database column names* (see
//! `backend::dml`) — pass through verbatim with no special handling. DML's TS
//! types aren't modeled here; the generator emits them as a static block.
